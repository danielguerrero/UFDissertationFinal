\usepackage{pgfplots}
\pgfplotsset{compat=1.17} %   pgfplots is tikz but better.

%% Uncomment the relevant line below if you have tables or figures.
\haveTablestrue%        Uncomment this if you have tables in your thesis.
\haveFigurestrue%       Uncomment this if you have figures in your thesis.
%\haveObjectstrue%       Uncomment this if you have Objects in your thesis. This is almost certainly not the case however.

%%% Below are the commands to set the degree type, department, graduation time, and chair. 
%       Most of these are self explanatory. 
%       Note: The \chair command takes an optional argument for a cochair. 
%           So if John was your chair and Jacob was a cochair, you would use \chair[Jacob]{John}.
%           If John was your chair and you had no cochair, you can simply use \chair{John}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\title{Search for non-resonant Higgs boson pair production in the four bottom quark decay channel with the CMS experiment}%  Put your title here.

\degreeType{Doctorate of Philosophy}%   Official name of your degree; eg "Doctorate of Philosophy".
\major{Physics}%                    Your official Department
\author{Daniel Fernando Guerrero Ibarra}%                  Your Name
\thesisType{Dissertation}%              Dissertation (PhD) or Thesis (Masters)
\degreeYear{2021}%                      Intended graduation year (not the year you submit the thesis)
\degreeMonth{December}%                   Month of graduation should be May, August, or December.
\chair[Darin Acosta]{Jacobo Konigsberg}%            Chair and Cochair (see comment block above).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% For each of the following, type in the name of the file that contains each section. 
%       They are assumed to be tex files, but if they aren't the command takes an optional argument for the extension.
%       So, you could load dedication.tex as your dedication file using \setDedicationFile{dedication}
%       You could load dedication.txt instead with \setDedicationFile[txt]{dedication}.
%       NOTE: For some compilers they may or may not add a .tex to the end of the file automatically.
%           If you get a "couldn't find dedication.tex.tex" type error, try the command with an empty optional argument,
%           e.g. \setDedicationFile[]{dedication}
%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%% These are REQUIRED sections; easiest to do via these commands.

\setDedicationFile{dedication}%                 Dedication Page
\setAcknowledgementsFile{acknowledgements}%     Acknowledgements Page
\setAbstractFile{abstract}%                     Abstract Page (This should only include the abstract itself)
\setReferenceFile{reference}{bst/JHEP}%         References. First argument is your bibtex source file %unsrturl %bst/apsrev4-2
%                                                       the second argument is your bibtex style file.
%\setReferenceFile{reference}{bst/apsrev4-2}
\setBiographicalFile{biography}%                Biography file of the Author (you).
%%% These are NOT required, so only use them if you actually need/have them.

\setAbbreviationsFile{abbreviations}%           Abbreviations Page
\setAppendixFile{appendix}%                     Appendix Content; hyperlinking might be weird.
\multipleAppendixtrue%                          Uncomment this if you have more than one appendix, 
%                                                   comment it if you have only one appendix.
